The "Free Robux" zip file (with a space) is a simple looping text box.
You can change the text displayed by opening with notepad.
The "FreeRobux" (no space) zip file is just a zip file that contains the FreeRobux (No Space) Batch file.
Use it to bypass Discord's system to view code in files to avoid malware.
It is harmless and only crashes or freezes your computer via browser tab overload.
P.S. If you edit with notepad then you can change the site it sends you to.
The "FreeRobux (Extract all)" Zip file is an INSANELY HUGE zipbomb.
